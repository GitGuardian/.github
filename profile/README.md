## Hello! üëã 

GitGuardian is the code security platform for the DevOps generation.

With automated secrets detection and remediation, our platform enables Dev, Sec, and Ops to advance together towards the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

We offer multiple tools to help keep their secrets safe and out of their source code:

- [GitGuardian Public Monitoring](https://www.gitguardian.com/monitor-public-github-for-secrets) <br> GitGuardian monitors GitHub round the clock for your secrets and sensitive data. We catch the leaks, you stop the intrusions.

- [GitGuardian Internal Monitoring](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform) <br> Enforce security rules across your VCS, DevOps tools, and infrastructure-as-code configurations ‚Äì with GitGuardian‚Äôs code security policy engine.

## Repos ‚å®Ô∏è

In addition to our monitoring platform offerings, GitGuardian is also proud to offer several open source tools found in this GitHub org.  You can find more about these and future projects by visiting [GitGuardian Labs](https://labs.gitguardian.com/):

- [ggshield](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield) <br> A CLI application that runs in your local environment or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 350 types of secrets, as well as other potential security vulnerabilities or policy breaks.

- [HasMyCodeLeaked](https://hasmycodeleaked.gitguardian.com/) <br>  A free tool that helps organizations and creators fingerprint their proprietary code, search for any matches across billions of files on GitHub and generate a report to identify repositories at risk.
